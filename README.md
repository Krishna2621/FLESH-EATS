The website enables users to search for recipes based on dish name, ingredients, cuisine, and dietary preferences. Each recipe page offers detailed information, including a full list of ingredients, step-by-step preparation instructions, and helpful tips to achieve the best results. For additional guidance, each recipe is linked to a video tutorial, allowing users to follow along with a visual demonstration.

Our platform is built to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience, with features like:

Search and Filter Options: Users can filter recipes by ingredients, cuisine type, preparation time, and more, making it easy to find the perfect dish for any occasion.
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
Interactive Recipe Page: Each recipe page is designed to be visually engaging, featuring high-quality images, instructional content, and embedded video tutorials.
Technologies and Languages Used:

Frontend:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for structuring, styling, and adding interactivity to the web pages.
React (or Vue/Angular) for building a dynamic, responsive user interface that allows for seamless navigation and real-time updating of recipe content.
Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling and layout, ensuring the site is visually appealing and responsive.
Backend:

Node.js with Express for handling server-side operations, API calls, and managing user requests.
Django or Flask (alternative backend frameworks if using Python) to structure the backend logic if using Python instead.
RESTful API for handling data requests and responses, making the frontend and backend communication efficient.
Database:

MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for storing recipe data, user preferences, and search filters. SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL are ideal if structured queries and relationships are key, while MongoDB may be suitable if you need more flexibility with unstructured data.
Additional Tools:

API Integrations (if necessary): To pull in additional information on ingredients, nutrition, or linking with third-party tutorial platforms.
Media Handling: Using cloud services like AWS S3 or Firebase for storing images and video links securely.
